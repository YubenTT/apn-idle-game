## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added the canonical Host WebGL2 render-lock and ten-pose runtime atlas, derived
  directly from the existing GLB with fixed camera, flat three-band shading, and
  one-pixel pivot/ratio/visor QA.
- Added a deterministic zero-npm asset pipeline for atlas layout, pivot/trim
  metadata, fixed WebP profiles, SHA-256 manifests, hot-pack ownership, and hard
  first-playable/per-pack size gates.
- Added deterministic active/idle pacing profiles and a silent Zone 1000/offline
  long-run gate. The Clean Era now measures 10.2 active-assisted hours or about
  2.4 mostly-idle calendar days before Corruption.
- Added 20 stable Clean Era Game Pack manifests, a byte-stable frozen runtime
  catalog, seeded different-genre season scheduling, and bounded corruption tiers.
- Accepted the catalog-driven Game Pack Route: 20 clean ten-zone packs, persistent
  world progress, bounded Corruption revisits, and one deterministic expansion path.
- Added ADR-0005 for GLB-locked hybrid Host rendering: image generation may guide
  pose/cleanup, while shipped geometry and pivots remain canonical GLB derivatives.
- Added a documentation contract test and a 32-issue, six-session autonomous
  implementation graph with a single final localhost review gate.

- **Design-system + docs backbone** (system-first redesign foundation; no runtime
  change — the vanilla ES + Canvas 2D game is untouched):
  - `brand/` design system — `tokens.css` (canonical CSS custom properties,
    reconciled with shipped hexes), `DESIGN-TOKENS.md`, `COMPONENTS.md`,
    `MASCOT-CANON.md`, `ART-DIRECTION.md`, `NAMING.md`
  - `docs/00_START_HERE.md` source-of-truth map · `VISION.md` (pillars + non-goals)
    · `SCREEN-SPECS.md` (mobile-first per-screen redesign) · `ART-PIPELINE.md` ·
    `PERF-BUDGET.md` · `QA-CHECKLIST.md` · `GLOSSARY.md` · `DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md` ·
    `DOC-UPDATE-POLICY.md`
  - `docs/REDESIGN-PLAN.md` — sequenced issue backlog (32 issues) grouped into 6
    autonomous delivery sessions, with per-issue acceptance criteria,
    dependencies, one final integrated user gate, and a release gate
  - `docs/decisions/` ADRs — **ADR-0001** keep vanilla ES + Canvas 2D (reject
    PixiJS/React rewrite), **ADR-0002** token-driven design system, **ADR-0003**
    GLB single-source mascot
- Runtime design-token foundation: `css/game.css` now imports `brand/tokens.css`;
  all 532 CSS color literals resolve through canonical or exact-value compatibility
  tokens, with a zero-dependency headless guard against regression.
- Economy-color contract for canonical Notes/SP values, explicit DOM roles,
  semantic Canvas tones, contrast floors, and retained primary-crimson roles.

### Changed

- Produced Clean Era Game Packs 01–05 as deterministic APN Patchline runtime
  sets, including approved target atlases, authored environments, props, masks,
  source records, and locked right-to-left foot pivots.
- Unified inline, Gear, and feed marks under one monochrome 2px rounded-stroke
  grammar; removed per-icon gradients/colors and added a static grammar gate.
- Reworked combat scaling around season-local Weapon power, bounded Route
  maturity, permanent-power budgeting, and soft boss timer cycles. Eight-hour
  offline rewards now stop Route progress at the next End Season boundary.
- Save schema v2 moves world progress from season-scoped `run` into persistent
  `route` state. End Season now keeps Route Zone and pack history.
- Loading checks v2 first and migrates v1 Zone/kills without deleting the legacy
  key; explicit New Game clears both keys.

- All font sizes, touch minimums, and safe-area values use exact design tokens.
  Screen-specific legacy geometry remains unchanged until its owning redesign issue.
- Notes now use canonical rose `#ff6a8f`; SP uses canonical violet `#b07cff`
  across HUD values, Ship/Hub rows, Build badges/costs, and Canvas floaters. Canvas
  token reads are cached, and small filled violet controls use dark ink.

### Tests

- Added CSS token-contract checks for first-rule import order, raw color literals,
  unresolved custom properties, and active canonical Notes/SP tokens.
- Added economy-role checks for legacy alias retirement, exact DOM selectors,
  cached Canvas role mapping, semantic domain events, and 4.5:1 contrast.
- Verified pixel-identical masked Run/Gear chrome against clean `origin/main` at
  428×926, 375×812, and 844×390 in a real browser.
- Reviewed the intentional I-002 browser diff against merged I-001 across Run,
  Build, Ship, and Hub at 375×812, 428×926, and 844×390 with zero console errors.

### Fixed

- Seeded the headless test RNG with the suite-local `0x41504e` (`APN`) seed so the
  three gear ordering assertions are reproducible without weakening them or
  changing production randomness.
- Corrected redesign backlog counts, dependencies, execution order, and session
  ownership so the repository plan matches the autonomous delivery control plane.

### Planned

- Save schema rename (bytes → signal) with migration
- PWA manifest
- Wire real IAP receipts for APN Pro / coin packs / boxes
- Rewarded-ad stubs (MindStudios monetization playbook)
